# Mission-Impossible-AI-Agent

In this problem we try to model a search agent called Ethan. The year is 1969 and the cold
war is at its peak. Tensions between the United States (USA) and the Soviet Union (USSR)
reached unprecedented levels. A double agent leaked the USSR’s plan to the American
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As the stakes could not be higher, the CIA turned to
its most renowned agent and the leader of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF), Ethan
Hunt. Ethan flied to an undiscovered island, however their helicoper malfunctioned and
everyone had to jump out. Everybody except Ethan is badly injured and is about to die.
It is Ethan’s mission now to bring all IMF members to the submarine using a truck that
has a fixed capacity. The island they crashed is a grid that consists of m x n cells where
m,n are between 5 and 15. Each cell either contains Ethan (with the truck), an ally or the
submarine. Ethan can move all in all directions across the grid, can carry IMF members
and can only drop them at the submarine. Using search algorithms we are going to device
a solution to help Ethan save the IMF members. This solution will be constructed using a
variety of search algorithms which are:

• Breadth-first search.

• Depth-first search.

• Iterative deepening search

• Uniform-cost search

• Greedy search with two heuristics

• A Star search with two admissible heuristics

Implementation Language: Java
